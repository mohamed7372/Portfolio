        "description": "My graduation project was to create correct timing tables for the College of Automated Media using artificial intelligence and get rid of a traditional method that is difficult. We used a genetic algorithm to create tables free of confusion. We also added the feature of requesting a class change or adding a class that occurs automatically by finding an empty section free time for the professor and students Only those concerned remain with the approval of the administration.",
